# Neural networks from Scratch in Go


Here I study the book http://nnfs.io and implement all the code with Golang instead of Python. The aim is to learn how neural networks are made inside and how it looks like to build is fully from the scratch without using frameworks like pytorch or tensorflow. 


### Build&run

Just use 
- `make build` to build the project
- `make run` to run the project
